## AI algorithms and concepts 

Main types of ML systems: classification and regression. Regression outputs a continous value, classification fits the output in one of the infered classes. 

## ML System Design

### analyse business needs and objectives

(DMLS) To successfuly design a ML system, it's important to pay attention to business requirements. The main objective of a lcompany is to increase the profits, so do the products. So, in order to design in harmony with business objectives, there has to be a stopping target to, say for instance, the increase in the models accuracy. How much effort in research, computing and refinements does the problem really requires to be solved? 

For every step in the project development, it`s important to plan how much effort will be applyed. In the same sense, [ref] as stated by the "law of diminishing returns", adding resources to a certain task will increase the returns. After a certain optimal point, the return over each added resource will gradually reduce to the point it may give negative marginal returns.

(DMLS) It's important to tie the performance of the ML model to actual business metrics, like increases in purchase rate of a recommendation system or detected frauds in a fraud detection system. A model can be accurate but still fail as a product if a it hasn't a proper design.

[DMLS] Characteristics desireble for a ML system: Reliability, scalability, maintainability and adaptability.

[DLMS] Overview of ML system development:

1- Project scoping - list goals, objectives, contraints. Estimate and allocate resources. 
2- Data engineering - access the raw data to sample and generate labels.
3- ML model development - extract features and develop models.
4- deployment - publish it to be available to the user.
5- Monitoring and retraining - retrain if needed, as the performance may degradate over time.
6- Business analysis - is the model solving the main questions of the business ?
