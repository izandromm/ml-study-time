## ML System Design

### analyse business needs and objectives

(DMLS) To successfuly design a ML system, it's important to pay attention to business requirements. The main objective of a lcompany is to increase the profits, so do the products. So, in order to design in harmony with business objectives, there has to be a stopping target to, say for instance, the increase in the models accuracy. How much effort in research, computing and refinements does the problem really requires to be solved? 

For every step in the project development, it`s important to plan how much effort will be applyed. In the same sense, [ref] as stated by the "law of diminishing returns", adding resources to a certain task will increase the returns. After a certain optimal point, the return over each added resource will gradually reduce to the point it may give negative marginal returns.

(DMLS) It's important to tie the performance of the ML model to actual business metrics, like increases in purchase rate of a recommendation system or detected frauds in a fraud detection system. A model can be accurate but still fail as a product if a it hasn't a proper design.
